<h1>
Wiring an authentic AIME Card Reader to USB
</h1>
<p>
Recently I was scouring yahoo auctions for good deals when I came upon an authentic AIME card reader, in its original housing for only Â¥1000 (about $8). I was excited to use this with my pseudo home setup before realizing that these readers don't connect via standard hardware such as USB. However, with a little  wire work and some adapters, that can be achieved.
